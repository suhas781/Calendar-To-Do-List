 Calendar To-Do List

Overview

This is a simple **Calendar To-Do List** web application that allows users to add, edit, and manage tasks for specific dates. The calendar is dynamically generated, and tasks are stored locally using **localStorage** to persist across browser refreshes. The app also features a colorful, neon-themed design with smooth animations, task categorization, and task prioritization (important vs. normal).
